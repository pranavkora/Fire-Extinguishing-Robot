# Fire-Extinguishing-Robot
**Objective**
The aim for our project is for our fire extinguishing robot to detect the flames of a fire and in 
doing so move towards the fire and pump out water around it to extinguish it. We could use 
these robots in small rooms or spaces. Could be deployed in server rooms and Power Plant 
control rooms. With enough time, hope to increase the load the robot can carry and also add a 
Video and Camera transmission. And also add remote control.
